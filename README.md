# CSE 278 Course Extension
This project was developed as a course extension for CSE 278 (Systems I) through the University Honors Program at Miami University. 
It builds upon topics discussed in the course, namely databases and network communication via HTTP. It is a simple relational
database management system (RDBMS) that performs the essential actions performed by a more advanced system: creating tables, retrieving
data from tables, updating data, and deleting data. It also supports a limited version of SQL joins by allowing users to select from
multiple tables. Additionally, the system allows users to retrieve data from files hosted on remote servers by entering a valid
URL beginning with "http://".
